    <h3>Inspiration For This Website</h3>
    <p>
      The cover page of this U.S. post colonial text (published in 1797), has
      this dedication: “Composed for the use of the Citizens of The United
      States.” Evidently these people truly cared about each
      other, as people presently should in the U.S. and elsewhere. It is in this spirit
      that this website is being developed.

        <h3>What is Here</h3>
        <p> 
            This website features some of the articles that I wrote. In doing so, I found the 
            following practice useful:  Secure papers, along with different versions of them,
            by backing them up on several cloud platforms, and still keep backups on drives.
